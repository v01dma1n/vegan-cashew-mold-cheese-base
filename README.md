## Process

### 1. Preparation & Cleaning

* **Soak & Boil:** Soak cashews for several hours, then boil. Drain well.
* **Sanitize:** Disinfect the blender and all utensils thoroughly.

### 2. Blending

* **Emulsify:** Blend warm cashews with water, coconut oil, salt, miso, and optional fermented tofu until smooth.
* *Note: Cashews must be warm enough to melt the oil but not so hot they break the emulsion.*

* **Inoculate:** Add chosen cultures or flavorings and blend briefly to incorporate.

### 3. Primary Fermentation

* **Heat:** Place the blender jar with the paste on a fermenting heater; wrap with towels.
* **Timing:** * **Standard:** 8–24 hours for tang.
    * **Mold-Ripened (Camembert):** 2–4 hours (shorter duration helps prevent black mold).

### 4. Shaping & Setting

* **Homogenize:** Mix the fermented paste to remove any dry surface skin.
* **Mold:** Transfer to glass containers lined with shrink wrap. Fold edges over.
* **Set:** Refrigerate for several hours until firm.

### 5. Salting & Initial Aging

* **First Salt:** Unwrap and salt the top surface.
* **Unmold:** Pull the shrink wrap to remove the wheel; flip onto embroidery canvas/parchment.
* **Second Salt:** Salt the bottom and sides.
* **Cave:** Place on a grid in a covered container and move to the cheese cave.

### 6. Ripening

* **Daily Flip:** Flip the cheese at least once a day (Days 5–9).
* **Mold Growth:** Between Days 10–14, white or blue mold should appear.
* **Spot Cleaning:** If undesired (black) mold appears, remove the spot and salt the area to prevent regrowth.
